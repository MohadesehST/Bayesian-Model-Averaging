###** Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) Method**
___
### BMA is a post-processing method for combining forecasts from different models to produce a new one that is more reliable and accurate than the output of an individual model. In this approach, a new Probability Density Function(PDF) is generated by combining various forecast PDFs of individual models based on their weighting. These weights reflect the models' forecasting skills, and the more accurate predictions receive a higher weight than the less accurate ones.
